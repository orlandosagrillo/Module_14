## Background

Assuming the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. The advisor's firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, the firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave the firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. Therefore, the advisor will plan to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firmâ€™s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

## What You're Creating

Combining ythe new algorithmic trading skills with the existing skills in financial Python programming and machine learning to create an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets.

## Jupyter Notebook Contents:

- Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.
- Adjust the input parameters to optimise the trading algorithm.
- Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.
- As part of the README.md file in the GitHub repository, create a report that compares the performance of the machine learning models based on the trading predictions that each makes and the resulting cumulative strategy returns.

## Instructions

#### Establish a Baseline Performance
#### Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm
#### Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier
#### Create an Evaluation Report
